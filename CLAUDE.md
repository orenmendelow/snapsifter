# SnapSifter

Local web app for quickly scrubbing through photos (HEIF/HIF and JPG/JPEG) from an external SSD. Rate photos with keyboard shortcuts, filter by rating, then sort into folders by rating and filetype.

## How to run

```
node server.js
```

Opens on port 4000. No arguments needed — the web UI provides a folder browser to select a photo directory at runtime. Auto-resumes the last loaded directory on startup (state saved to `~/.snapsifter/sessions.json`).

## Architecture

- **Backend**: Express server converts HEIF to JPEG on the fly via sips, caches results in `.cache/` inside the photo directory. JPG/JPEG files served directly (no conversion). Separate cache for full-size (2000px) and thumbnails (300px). EXIF parsed with exifr (full parse, not filtered).
- **Frontend**: Single HTML file with inline CSS/JS. No frameworks. Dark aesthetic — deep black background, warm amber accent, high-contrast white text.
- **Folder picker**: On startup, shows a directory browser. User navigates to a folder containing photos and clicks Load. Volumes from /Volumes/ shown as quick-jump shortcuts. System directories (Library, Applications, node_modules, etc.) filtered from browse.
- **Ratings**: Stored in `ratings.json` in the photo directory. Written to disk on every change. Keyed by filename stem (e.g. `DSCF6733`).
- **Rating values**: 1 = ditch, 2 = maybe, 3 = like. Backend stores numbers only.
- **Filter modes**: All / Unrated / Like / Ditch / Maybe. Tab cycles through them. Navigation stays within the filtered subset. Filmstrip reflects current filter.
- **Preloading**: Next and previous images preloaded in background for instant scrubbing.
- **Thumbnails**: Lazy-loaded via IntersectionObserver as filmstrip scrolls.
- **Supported extensions**: .HIF, .HEIF, .JPG, .JPEG (all case insensitive). RAF and other RAW files are carried along during sort (matched by filename stem) but not displayed.
- **Zoom**: Click to zoom in (3x max), click again to zoom out. Mouse position controls pan via transform-origin (no translate). Moving mouse across viewport maps to moving across zoomed image.
- **Sort**: Moves rated files into `Liked/`, `Maybe/`, `Ditch/` subfolders, each with filetype subfolders (`HIF/`, `JPG/`, `RAF/`). All files sharing a stem are moved together (RAW+JPG pairs). Unsort reverses the operation.
- **Sessions**: Persisted in `~/.snapsifter/sessions.json`. Resume lands on first unrated photo.

## Files

- `server.js` — Express backend. All API endpoints, sips conversion, sessions, file sorting with filetype subfolders.
- `public/index.html` — Single-file frontend. Inline CSS + JS. Landing screen (tree browser + preview) and viewer (image + filmstrip + filters).
- `launch.command` — Double-click launcher for distribution. Checks for Node.js, runs npm install, starts server, opens browser.
- `README.txt` — Minimal usage instructions for distribution.
- `~/.snapsifter/sessions.json` — Persists sessions (id, dir, name, lastOpened, lastPosition, fileCount, ratedCount).
- `ratings.json` — Written into each photo directory. Keyed by filename stem.

## API endpoints

- `GET /api/status` — whether a directory is loaded, which one, file count
- `GET /api/browse?dir=/path` — list subdirectories with photo counts (default: home dir, system dirs filtered)
- `GET /api/volumes` — mounted volumes from /Volumes/
- `POST /api/load` `{dir: "/path"}` — set active photo directory
- `GET /api/files` — list of photo files (requires loaded dir)
- `GET /api/ratings` — current ratings object
- `POST /api/rate` `{filename, rating}` — rate a file
- `GET /api/image/{*filepath}` — full-size image (HEIF converted to JPEG, JPG served directly)
- `GET /api/thumb/{*filepath}` — 300px thumbnail
- `GET /api/meta/{*filepath}` — full EXIF metadata (date, camera, lens, exposure, dimensions, file size, GPS, film simulation)
- `GET /api/sessions` — sessions list with accessibility check
- `POST /api/save-position` `{position}` — save viewer position in session
- `GET /api/preview-thumb/:dir/{*filepath}` — preview thumbnail (dir is base64-encoded)
- `GET /api/session-thumb/:sessionId/{*filepath}` — session thumbnail
- `POST /api/sort` `{mode: "move"|"copy"}` — sort files into Rating/EXT/ subfolders (e.g. Liked/HIF/, Ditch/RAF/)
- `POST /api/unsort` — reverse sort, move files back to root (handles both nested and legacy flat structure)

## Key shortcuts

1/2/3 = rate (ditch/maybe/like) + auto-advance to next sequential, 0 = clear rating, arrows = navigate, N = jump to next unrated, K = like over previous, Tab = cycle filter, Space = toggle metadata, F = fullscreen, Z = zoom, Escape = back to folder picker (when at first photo), ? = help

## Open bugs / unresolved feedback (verbatim from Oren)

- **General UI/UX**: "much of the UI/UX needs to be more intuitive" — ongoing.
- **Progress bar**: Increased to 5px with hover text. May still be too subtle.
- **No logo**: Favicon is aperture SVG. No app logo yet.

## Distribution

Distributed as a zip (`SnapSifter.zip` on Desktop). Contains launch.command for double-click start. macOS only (requires sips). Brother (Eytan) testing — needs `xattr -cr ~/Downloads/SnapSifter` after download to bypass Gatekeeper.

## Recipe Editor — Film Simulation Workflow

New mode in SnapSifter for dialing in Fujifilm film simulation recipes and batch-applying them to liked RAFs via X RAW Studio.

### Camera
- Model: X100VI
- Serial: 5AA21758
- FP1 device string: `X100VI`, version: `X100VI_0100` (verify from existing FP1 or X RAW Studio)

### Architecture

**SnapSifter owns**: recipe editing UI, recipe storage, FP1 export, diverse grid selection, grid display with before/after toggle, recipe card view, swap/shuffle grid photos.

**Simulation / rendering**: Camera hardware does the actual RAF→JPEG/HIF conversion. Two possible approaches investigated in session 9:
- **X RAW Studio automation** (AppleScript/Accessibility): UI is fully accessible via System Events. Can select profiles, thumbnails, trigger conversion. Brittle (timing-dependent, app must be frontmost). Verified: menu items, profile table, parameter table all addressable.
- **Direct PTP over USB** (rawji/FilmKit): Camera speaks PTP protocol. Open-source tools exist (rawji=Python/pyusb, FilmKit=TypeScript/WebUSB). FilmKit verified on X100VI. **BLOCKED on macOS**: `ptpcamerad` (system daemon) claims the USB interface exclusively. Neither libusb (pyusb), nor WebUSB (Chrome), nor sudo can override IOKit's PTP device protection. Only properly entitled native macOS apps (like X RAW Studio) can claim PTP devices. Would require a signed native helper binary or kext exclusion.

**Current viable path**: Automate X RAW Studio via AppleScript/System Events. Not ideal (app must be frontmost, timing-dependent) but functional. FilmKit's TypeScript PTP code is the gold standard reference if the macOS USB permission issue is ever solved (e.g., via a signed helper app).

### PTP research artifacts (session 9)
- `/tmp/rawji/` — Python PTP tool (pyusb), tested X-T30, profile format differs from X100VI
- `/tmp/filmkit/` — TypeScript WebUSB tool, **verified on X100VI**, proper d185 profile patching, command queue with latest-wins render cancellation
- `ptp-test.py`, `ptp-session-test.py`, `ptp-direct-test.py` — test scripts (can delete)
- `public/webusb-test.html` — WebUSB test page (can delete)
- Camera USB PID: 0x0305 (not in rawji's list, found via Fuji vendor ID 0x04CB)
- FilmKit d185 profile: 625 bytes, field indices confirmed on X100VI (see `/tmp/filmkit/src/profile/d185.ts`)
- Noise Reduction uses proprietary encoding (NOT ×10): {-4: 0x8000, -3: 0x7000, -2: 0x4000, -1: 0x3000, 0: 0x2000, 1: 0x1000, 2: 0x0000, 3: 0x6000, 4: 0x5000}

### Recipe data model (`recipes.json` in photo directory)

```json
{
  "recipes": {
    "recipe-id-uuid": {
      "id": "uuid",
      "title": "Warm Street",

### FP1 generation

XML format for X RAW Studio. Saved to `~/Library/Application Support/com.fujifilm.denji/X RAW STUDIO/X100VI/X100VI_0100/`. X RAW Studio must be quit and reopened to pick up new/changed FP1 files.

**FP1 format constraints (hard-won):**
- Filename MUST use `.FP1` (uppercase extension). Lowercase `.fp1` is silently ignored.
- Label attribute MUST NOT contain dashes (`-`). Dashes cause silent rejection. Use alphanumeric + spaces only.
- `version` on ConversionProfile: `1.12.0.0` (matches X RAW Studio V1.31)
- `SerialNumber`: `5935373131322503252913201629C3` (full hex from camera)
- `TetherRAWConditonCode`: `X100VI_0100` (not empty)
- `IOPCode`: `FF179503` (X100VI-specific)
- Required structural elements: `SourceFileName/`, `Fileerror`, `RotationAngle`, `StructVer` (65536), `ShootingCondition`, `FileType`, `ImageSize`, `ImageQuality`, `WBShootCond`, `HDR/`, `DigitalTeleConv`, `PortraitEnhancer/`
- Film simulation names differ from display names: ClassicNeg→ClassicNEGA, Nostalgic→NostalgicNEGA, ProNegStd→NEGAStd, ProNegHi→NEGAhi, Mono→BW
- `ExposureBias`: `0` for zero (not `P0P0`)
- `WideDRange`: `0` (not `OFF`)
- X RAW Studio cannot browse ExFAT volumes — needs Full Disk Access + Removable Volumes permission in System Settings

### Diverse grid selection algorithm

1. Extract EXIF from all RAFs in Liked/RAF/ (focal length, ISO, time of day, WB)
2. Generate JPEG thumbs via sips for image analysis
3. Compute feature vector per image via Sharp .stats() (R/G/B mean, stdev, entropy)
4. Farthest-point sampling: pick first randomly, then greedily maximize minimum distance to selected set
5. Default grid size: 9 photos (3x3)

### API endpoints (new)

- `POST /api/recipe-load` `{dir}` — set Recipe Lab's directory (independent from Photo Cull), persists to `~/.snapsifter/recipe-session.json`
- `GET /api/recipe-status` — returns `{loaded, dir}` for Recipe Lab
- `GET /api/recipes` — list saved recipes (requires `recipeDir`)
- `POST /api/recipe` `{title, params}` — create recipe draft
- `PUT /api/recipe/:id` `{title?, params?}` — update recipe

- `GET /api/recipe-exif-defaults?dir=...` — read EXIF from first RAF in Liked/RAF/ via exiftool, return deduced recipe params (no middleware required)
- `GET /api/camera-status` — checks if Fujifilm camera is connected via USB (system_profiler SPUSBDataType)
- `GET /api/grid-select?dir=...&count=9` — select diverse photos, return file list + feature data
- `POST /api/grid-replace` `{current[], replace: index}` — swap one grid photo for next best diverse pick
- `POST /api/grid-shuffle` `{count: 9}` — fully re-randomize grid selection
- `GET /api/preview-thumb/:dir/{*filepath}` — 800px thumbnail (dir is base64-encoded), no middleware
- `GET /api/preview-image/:dir/{*filepath}` — 2000px full-size (dir is base64-encoded), no middleware
- `POST /api/scan-outputs` `{stems}` — scan for reprocessed HIFs in SnapSifter Preview/, Liked/RAF/, root
- `GET /api/preview-output-image/:stem` — serve reprocessed HIF as JPEG (2000px), cached in SnapSifter Preview/.cache/
- `POST /api/prewarm-thumbs` `{dir, files}` — parallel sips thumbnail generation for grid photos
- `POST /api/batch-recipe-exif` `{dir, files}` — per-file recipe EXIF extraction + majority params computation

### UI screens

**Recipe Lab** (separate tool from Photo Cull — co-equal entry from landing):
- Left: recipe parameter controls (420px panel, custom dropdowns + sliders, amber fill-from-center)
- Right: photo grid (auto-fill layout, responsive to mixed aspect ratios) with per-cell "SWAP" button and shuffle all
- Top: recipe title (click-to-edit), recipe picker dropdown, save/export FP1 buttons, dir label (clickable to change folder)
- Click grid photo to enlarge in lightbox overlay (2000px full-size via `/api/preview-image/`)
- Grid photos shown in justified row layout (slight crop OK) with EXIF overlay (filename, focal length, ISO, aperture)
- Film sim badge on photos that differ from majority/current recipe
- Grid greys out (opacity + desaturation) when recipe params change — signals photos are stale
- "As Shot" virtual recipe auto-populated from majority EXIF of grid RAFs when no recipe selected
- Staging bar shows after FP1 export with path to `SnapSifter Preview/` folder + scan button

**Landing page architecture**: Two co-equal tools in header tabs: "Photo Cull" and "Recipe Lab". Both share the same `#browser-section` layout — tabs swap the tree/right panels. Photo Cull tab shows cull tree → viewer. Recipe Lab tab shows recipe tree (with Recent sessions from cull history) → recipe editor. These are independent workflows with independent server state (`activeDir` vs `recipeDir`).

### Recipe Lab server state

- `recipeDir` — independent from Photo Cull's `activeDir`, set via `POST /api/recipe-load`
- Persisted to `~/.snapsifter/recipe-session.json`
- Recipe CRUD endpoints use `requireRecipeDir` middleware (not `requireActiveDir`)
- `recipes.json` stored in `recipeDir` (not `activeDir`)

### Implementation phases

**Phase 1 — Foundation (COMPLETE)**
- A: Recipe data model + CRUD endpoints in server.js — DONE
- B: Diverse grid selection algorithm + endpoint (EXIF-based farthest-point sampling) — DONE
- C: FP1 XML generation module — DONE, validated end-to-end with X RAW Studio + X100VI

**Phase 2 — UI (session 9 complete)**
- D: Recipe editor UI — BUILT, params panel 520px via grid-template-columns
- E: Grid display — justified row layout (flex-wrap, row-based packing, 220px target height), 12 photos, slight crop OK
- F: Recipe Lab folder browser + recent sessions direct-load (no intermediate button)
- G: Grid uses `/api/preview-thumb/` (800px) for cells, `/api/preview-image/` (2000px) for lightbox
- H: Stale overlay — dark overlay with "EXPORT FP1 TO X RAW STUDIO" button + "REVERT CHANGES" link, auto-clears when params match clean snapshot
- I: Lightbox with prev/next arrows (click + keyboard) and counter
- J: Swap picks randomly from full HIF folder (not diversity-constrained)
- K: "As Shot" virtual recipe — batch EXIF from grid RAFs, majority params, per-photo film sim badges
- L: EXIF batch caching (in-memory, invalidates on file count change)
- M: Camera USB detection via system_profiler + ioreg fallback (polls every 10s)
- N: UI brightness pass — text-dim #999, borders 0.12-0.18 opacity, slider rails #555
- O: Recipe management — picker dropdown with per-recipe DUP/DEL actions, film sim subtitle, MODIFIED badge, dynamic count header, DELETE button in topbar with confirm dialog
- P: Photo Cull keyboard handler skips recipe screen and focused inputs (was intercepting 'n' during title edit)
- Q: FP1 export creates `SnapSifter Preview/` staging folder with symlinks to grid RAFs
- R: Staging bar UI with scan-for-outputs button
- S: Parallel thumbnail pre-warming via `/api/prewarm-thumbs`
- T: Skip redundant grid-select calls when directory unchanged
- U: Persist active tool tab (Photo Cull / Recipe Lab) via localStorage

**Critical session 9 feedback (Oren — must address before Phase 3):**
- Recipe Lab UX is fundamentally broken. Needs complete rethink of flow, not incremental fixes.
- Grid loads too slowly (exiftool batch + sips still the bottleneck despite prewarm)
- Grid photos too small, don't fill viewport (220px target height inadequate, dead space)
- Camera detection is a lie — shows "connected" when camera is not connected. Fix or remove.
- "As Shot" recipe doesn't load — saved recipe ("Iceland") auto-loads instead of EXIF-deduced baseline
- Recipe rename doesn't update FP1 filename in X RAW Studio
- "SnapSifter Preview" folder name is nonsensical — rename to something meaningful (e.g., recipe name)
- No recipe management/library screen — nowhere to browse, view, or curate recipes
- No menu/nav structure — too few screens, no back buttons, no breadcrumbs
- No collage selection UX — user wants: random collage (with cycle-all and cycle-individual, never-repeat-in-session), OR manual photo picker modal (up to 9 photos)
- Each photo in collage should show its "as shot" recipe or film sim badge
- Different recipes in collage must be clearly indicated
- App must feel cohesive across culling and recipe workflows — sessions, back buttons, menus, persistence
- Cull directory browser should show photo previews during folder navigation (prior feedback, may be broken)

**Oren's full Recipe Lab vision (session 9, verbatim distillation):**
1. Pick a folder → random collage OR manual photo selection (up to 9)
2. Collage fills the view — no dead space, well-sized, enough photos to evaluate across scenes
3. Each photo shows its "as shot" recipe/film sim
4. Left panel shows recipe params (same as X RAW Studio / camera) starting from "as shot" baseline
5. Two ways to dial in a recipe:
   - **Single-parameter comparison**: Pick one photo + one param + handful of values → simulate same photo with each → side-by-side/slider comparison
   - **Full-recipe on collage**: Apply full recipe to all collage photos → toggle original vs simulated → click to zoom/compare individual photos
6. Simulation via camera hardware (X RAW Studio automation or direct PTP — see Architecture)
7. Recipe cookbook: named recipes with example photos, browse/modify/share/rename
8. Toggle between original and simulated collage
9. RAW files never modified. Original HIFs kept until explicit batch processing.

**Phase 3 — Recipe Lab Rebuild (next)**
- A: Fix camera detection (false positives) or remove until reliable
- B: Collage selection UX — random (cycle-all/cycle-individual, never-repeat) + manual picker modal (up to 9)
- C: Grid layout fix — photos must fill viewport, much larger target row height
- D: "As Shot" baseline — always start from EXIF-deduced params, never auto-load saved recipe
- E: Recipe library screen — browse all saved recipes with example photos
- F: Navigation overhaul — proper nav bar, back buttons, breadcrumbs, session persistence
- G: X RAW Studio automation via AppleScript — simulate recipe on collage photos
- H: Before/after comparison — toggle original vs simulated, per-photo zoom, slider divider
- I: Single-parameter comparison — one photo, multiple values, side-by-side
- J: Recipe cookbook management — rename (re-exports FP1), share, example photos

### Workflow (user perspective — revised)

1. Sort photos in SnapSifter (existing feature) → Liked/HIF/ and Liked/RAF/ have the keepers
2. Open Recipe Lab → grid shows diverse picks from **Liked/HIF/** (fast loading)
3. Recipe params auto-populated from RAF EXIF metadata (current camera settings)
4. Tweak recipe params → grid fades (stale indicator) → offer to run simulation
5. Export FP1 → file appears in X RAW Studio's profile directory
6. Connect X100VI via USB → open X RAW Studio → select grid RAFs → apply profile → convert → output to preview folder
7. Back in SnapSifter → compare new output vs previous iterations (split-view zoom)
8. Repeat 4-7 until satisfied with recipe
9. Batch-apply final recipe to all Liked/RAF/ files via X RAW Studio
10. RAFs in Liked/RAF/ are never modified

## Anti-patterns discovered

- **Zoom math with translate + transform-origin: 0 0**: Failed repeatedly. Flex centering offsets, maxWidth/maxHeight changes, and stale imgRect all cause position errors. The working approach is: keep image flex-centered, use `transform-origin` at the desired point + `scale()` only. No translate. Mouse pan = moving transform-origin.
- **Server restart required**: After editing server.js, the server MUST be restarted (`kill port 4000, node server.js`). Forgetting this caused sort bugs that appeared unfixed.
- **CSS display:none override**: Setting `el.style.display = ''` does NOT override a CSS rule of `display: none`. Must set to explicit value like `'inline-block'` or `'flex'`.
- **Recipe Lab needs its own directory picker**: Cannot depend on cull session's `loadedDir`. Must have independent folder selection UI. DONE — uses own `recipeDir` server state.
- **The two tools are SEPARATE**: Photo Cull and Recipe Lab are independent workflows. No crossover buttons between them. Landing page is the hub where user chooses which tool to use. Both tabs share the same browser-section layout.
- **RAF thumbnails need format flag**: `sips` requires `-s format jpeg` for RAF→JPEG conversion (same as HEIF). Without it, output format is undefined.
- **Grid should show HEIF not RAF**: Loading RAFs via sips is slow. Grid should display Liked/HIF/ files (already camera-processed, fast). RAFs only used for X RAW Studio processing.
- **Grid-select is slow**: `exiftool` parsing all RAFs in a directory is inherently slow. Switching to HEIF display eliminates this for the grid. EXIF caching still useful for diverse selection algorithm.
- **No intermediate Load button for recent sessions**: When user clicks a previously culled session in Recipe Lab, load directly.
- **display: flex vs display: grid**: `showRecipeEditor()` must set `recipeMain.style.display = 'grid'` not `'flex'`. The grid-template-columns only work with display: grid. This caused the params panel to render at 155px instead of 520px.
- **exifr cannot parse RAF files**: Returns "Unknown file format" on Fujifilm RAF. Use exiftool CLI instead. The `extractRecipeFromExiftool()` function parses exiftool's human-readable JSON output (values like `"-2 (soft)"`, `"Red +40, Blue -120"`).
- **WB fine tune units**: exiftool reports WB shift as internal values (e.g. `Red +40`). Divide by 20 to get camera-display range (-9 to +9). So `+40` = `+2`, `-120` = `-6`.
- **EXIF batch is slow**: exiftool on 714 RAFs takes ~10s. Cache results in memory keyed by directory, invalidate when file count changes. grid-select/replace/shuffle all share the cache.
- **Swap must be random**: Farthest-point sampling for swap always returns the same deterministic result. Swap should pick randomly from the full HIF folder excluding current grid photos.
- **system_profiler SPUSBDataType can return empty**: On some Macs this command returns nothing. Camera detection needs `ioreg -p IOUSB -l` as fallback — camera appears as "USB PTP Camera" not "FUJIFILM".
- **FP1 export response must include `ok: true`**: Frontend checks `res.ok` to show success/failure toast. Missing this field causes false "Export failed" messages.
- **Grid cell overflow: hidden clips photos**: In old masonry layout, cells must NOT have `overflow: hidden`. In justified row layout, `overflow: hidden` is OK because cell dimensions are explicitly controlled.
- **Staging folder must not start with dot**: `.snapsifter-preview` shows up in X RAW Studio's file browser. Use `SnapSifter Preview` (no dot prefix) so it's obvious and visible in all file browsers.
- **No stray color hex values**: All UI colors must use CSS vars (--amber, --amber-dim, --text-dim, etc). Hardcoded hex colors like #c8a555, #b08d57 clash with the actual --amber (#c45a30).
- **Skip redundant grid-select**: Don't re-fetch grid-select if gridPhotos is already populated for the current directory. Track via lastLoadedDir in recipeState.
- **Parallel sips for thumbnails**: Sequential sips calls (12 x 0.5-1s) are too slow. Use prewarm endpoint with Promise.all + exec (not execSync).
- **Photo Cull keydown handler catches all keys globally**: Must check `screen !== 'recipe'` and `activeElement` is not INPUT/TEXTAREA, otherwise recipe title editing is broken (e.g., 'n' triggers jumpToNextUnrated).
- **macOS blocks USB PTP access via libusb/WebUSB**: ptpcamerad (system daemon) claims PTP devices exclusively via IOKit. Cannot be killed without sudo, respawns from launchd. Even sudo + WebUSB cannot claim the interface. Only properly entitled/signed native macOS apps can access PTP cameras. This rules out pyusb, node-usb, and browser WebUSB for direct camera communication.
- **Camera detection shows false positives**: ioreg fallback matches "USB PTP Camera" which appears even when no Fuji camera is connected (generic USB storage devices can match). Must validate by checking vendor ID or product-specific strings.

## Session endpoints

- `DELETE /api/session/:id` — removes a session from Recent list (sessions.json). The ratings.json in the directory is preserved for potential re-import.
- **walkDir only finds supported images**: For sort stem-matching (RAW pairs), must scan ALL files in directory, not use walkDir which filters by isSupportedImage.
